# zero's zsh

Adapted theme for zsh based on:
* prose theme + guide (see: http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/02/my-extravagant-zsh-prompt/)
* the many preexisting themes (see: https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/themes)

# installation

* install zsh (use package manager)
* install oh-my-zsh (package manager if possible)
* chsh -s $(which zsh)
