# zero's zsh

Consists of a theme and a plugin. They can be used independently. Both have to be activated explicitly.

### theme

* simple clean design
* support for git and hg repositories
* 256-color theme

Set theme to `zero` if you have a dark terminal:

Set theme to `zero-light` if you have a light terminal:

If you want to quickly change the theme, use the plugin (see below). This will provide shortcut commands for theming:

    dark_theme        # sets the theme for dark terminals (white text on black background)
    light_theme       # sets the theme for light terminals (black text on white background)

There are also theme-related commands:

    zsh_reload_theme        # quickly reload zsh
    zsh_load_theme "zero"   # load a theme, eg this theme
