# zero's zsh

Consists of a theme and a plugin. They can be used independently. Both have to be activated explicitly.

### theme

* simple clean design
* support for git and hg repositories
* 256-color theme

Set theme to `zero-dark` if you have a dark terminal (white text on black background):

Set theme to `zero-light` if you have a light terminal (black text on white background):

If you want to quickly change the theme, use the plugin (see below). This will provide shortcut commands for theming:

    dark_theme        # sets theme to zero-dark
    light_theme       # sets theme to zero-light

There are also theme-related commands:

    zsh_reload_theme             # quickly reload zsh
    zsh_load_theme "zero-dark"   # load a theme, eg this theme

### plugin

Please see [plugins/zero/zero.plugin.zsh](zero.zsh/blob/master/plugins/zero/zero.plugin.zsh). All changes are well documented.

## Requirments

* zsh
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

## Installation

Please run the installation of `oh-my-zsh` before installing zero.zsh. Afterwards run:

    wget -O- https://raw.github.com/arlimus/zero.zsh/master/bootstrap.sh | sh -

On Macs you may require to install wget. E.g. via `brew install wget`

Alternatively:

    git clone https://github.com/arlimus/zero.zsh.git
    cd zero.zsh
    ./install.sh

Now enable it in your `~/.zshrc`:

    # set zero-dark or zero-light as the theme
    ZSH_THEME="zero-dark"

    # add zero to the list of plugins
    plugins=(git zero)

Reload your zsh and you are ready to go.


## Configuration

If you want to further edit the theme, have a look at `zero-dark.zsh-theme` or `zero-light.zsh-theme` respectively. You can quickly see all important configuration options.

For example, if you don't like:

    hostname:path $>

and want:

    hostname:path ∅>

add this at the end of your `.zshrc`:

    export ZSH_THEME_PROMPT_CHAR_USER="∅"
